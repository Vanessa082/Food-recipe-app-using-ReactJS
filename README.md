# Food Recipe App (ReactJS)

## Overview
The **Food Recipe App** is a web application built using **ReactJS** that allows users to search for various food recipes by ingredients or cuisine type. The app fetches recipe data from an external API and displays detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and images. The user can browse, filter, and explore different recipes for inspiration.

## Features
- **Search Recipes:** Search for recipes by ingredients or dish names.
- **Recipe Details:** View detailed information about each recipe, such as ingredients, cooking steps, and images.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive and works on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Favorites:** Save favorite recipes to a list for easy access (optional feature).
  
## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS:** Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Fetch API:** For making HTTP requests to fetch recipe data from an external API.
- **React Router:** For handling navigation between different app pages (Home, Recipe Detail, etc.).
- **CSS Modules/Styled Components:** For styling the application.
